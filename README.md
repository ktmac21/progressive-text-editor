## Description

In this week's homework my task was to add progressive web app components to an existing text editor that runs in the browser. Once completed, the editor functions as a single page application that meets PWA criteria. The application is discoverable, installable, linkable, network independent, progressively enhanced but still works on older browser versions, responsively designed, and secure. The application features a number of data persistence techniques that will serve as redundancy in case one of the options is not supported by the browser. The application also functions offline!

## Deployment

Heroku Link:

https://fierce-temple-71813.herokuapp.com/

## Technologies Used:

1. WorkBox
2. Heroku
3. IndexedDB
4. Express.js
5. Babel
6. Node.js
7. Javascript
8. Webpack 
9. Codemirror


## Usage

When the progressive web application is opened, the user is presented with a simple text editor that works in the browser. The application has an install feature so it can be run offline. When the user clicks the install button, the application installs onto the users desktop. The user data is saved in the IndexedDB database located in the browser.
